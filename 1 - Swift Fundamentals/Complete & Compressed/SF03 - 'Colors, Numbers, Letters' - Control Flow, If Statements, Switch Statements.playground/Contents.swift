//  🏔️ MTECH Code Challenge SF03: "Colors, Numbers, Letters"
//  Concept: Practice using if and switch statements to evaluate variables

//  Instructions:
    //  Under each step below, write the required code.
    //  As you work, change the color, number, and letter constants to see how it changes the outcome of each control flow statement.

//  ⌺ Black Diamond Challenge:
    //  Create a switch statement that will print "That's a color!" for any primary or secondary color, and "I don't know that one." for any other string.

import Foundation

// Starter code: Change the value of these constants to thoroughly test your code.
let color = "blue"
let number = 50
let letter = "a"

//  1) Create an if statement that checks to see if the color variable is "blue"
    //  If it is, print "That is my favorite color!"
    //  If the color is not "blue" then print "Cool!"
    //  Only one of the print statments should print when you run your code. NOT BOTH.
if color == "blue" {
    print("That is my favorite color")
} else {
    print("Cool!")
}

//  2) Check to see if the number variable is between 1 and 100.
    //  If it is, print "That is a valid number
    //  If it is not between 1 and 100 print "That is NOT a valid number"
if number > 1 && number < 100 {
    print("That is a valid number.")
} else {
    print("That is NOT a valid number")
}

//  3) Create a switch statement to check if letter is a vowel.
    //  If it is, print "letter is a vowel!"
    //  If it is not a vowel then print "letter is a consonant"
switch letter {
case "a", "e", "i", "o", "u":
    print("letter is a vowel")
default:
    print("letter is a consonant")
}

switch color {
case "red", "yellow", "blue", "green", "orange", "violet":
    print("That's a color!")
default:
    print("I don't know that one.")
}
